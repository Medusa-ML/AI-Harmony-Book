tts --text "There is little doubt that artificial intelligence will contribute to profound transformations over the next decades. At its best, the technology has the potential to release us from mundane work and create a utopia in which all time is leisure time. At its worst, World War 3 might be fought by armies of superintelligent robots. But they won't be led by Hal, Skynet or their newer artificially intelligent relatives. Even in the worst case, the robots will remain under our command, and we will have only ourselves to blame." \
