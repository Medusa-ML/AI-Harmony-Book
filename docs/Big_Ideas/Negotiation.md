# Negotiation

- Understand yourself first
- “Price is only an issue if there’s no perception of value”
- Leverage Is related to who can walk away the easiest :)
- You can still be very strong and aggressive but relationship preserving, you can anchor very aggressively, but in a friendly way.
- You can frame very agressively
- Decide your claming strategy in advance
- differences are GOOD for negotiation, benefits to trade, guns and butter etc...
- Understand and be able to state your counterparts position better than they can
* You must have the best policy, and the best negotiation to get there to really win (Bill Clinton Politics + Policy)
* Language is the software of the mind

# Tactics

- Ask open ended questions
- Be clear about your needs, understand clearly the clients needs
- Label people’s feelings and talk about the process when things go wrong
- TAKE BREAKS
