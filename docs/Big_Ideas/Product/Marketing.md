# Strategic Marketing

Rule #1: Make what you can sell, DO NOT sell what you can make.

Goal: Profitably satisfy customer needs

## Drill bit example
Who are your competitors if you are Black and Decker?
-Flower shops, tie sellers (dad gifts)
-Lasers, shoes, handymen
-3M strips

## Margin Analyis (think contact case)
-if you can make unlimited contacts, sell dailies
-If not, sell the best you can given your constraints,
-For retailers its sqft of shelf space
-for consultants it’s billable hours
-For Espositos it should be time and real estate.


## Do not get enamored with technology
* Pringles did it, failed
* Daily contacts did it, did not make a splash
same goes with investing btw.

## Be explicit on how you market segment, you say you want green-minded people but how exactly do you segment them that way?

## Use total economic value as a guidepost for your storytelling. Think the pill that cleans your pool, you are saving time draining and refilling, putting them out of business but also saving time, be explicit in where costs are saved. 

## Use a chain model (how many golfballs fit in an airplane) to model new markets, think the transactions online in the year 2000 model, make predictions based on install base, purchase size etc… another example is coke model Population Incidence of consumption, times/frequency and amount they consume, see what variables you can control. 

# Positioning statement

* We need a positioning statemnt before a product

* Target Segment (Pringles: Kids, Acuvue: Rare Users)
* Point of Difference (Pringles: Packaging, Dailies: Economical)
* Frame of Reference (Pringles: Snacks, Dailies: Other contacts)

* Politics uses positioning all of the time, I’m not running against my opponent, I’m running against Obamacare, I’m running to support our Troops or Trump or whatever

* Think Microwave as cooker vs Microwave as reheating device.


# Segmentation

* Hopefuls vs Fearfuls (pregnancy tests)

* Apple, this changed over time: Personal vs Business in the 1980s with the Apple II, First time vs Repeat users with the iMac.

* Map segment attractiveness against your business capabiites.

* Keep an eye on your target vs your actual buyers

# Branding

* Take a position, especially if you are small and have young customers
* Cult model: build a passionate customer base before you scale, count on them to evangelize


# Marketing 3

* LOW CAC IS NOT IDEAL, the stickier customers are often harder to acquire… Fast In- Fast Out.

* Segmentation should be based on clustering first, then pick your segments…

* Look at conjoint surveys, discrete-choice modeling
