# PEOPLE WANT
* Purpose (Your job is to improve the work!)
* Progress (What is my next project? What am I learning?)
* Feedback (How are you doing today? How many accidents did you have today?)


# THINK WIN/WIN, DON'T BULLSHIT PEOPLE
* France vs US. Don't confuse friendly with win-win, Americans are friendly but in France friendliness is a sign that you're full of shit. 


# Infromation/Delegation

* Use information scouts, the newest, lowest man knows the most
* Delegate tasks to people who care about the problem MORE than you do

# Hiring and Skills

* Technical people wanna focus on self-development
* If you self-selected to work for Steve Jobs, he was a genius
* If you were ASSIGNED to wokr for Steve Jobs, he was an asshole

# Building credibility

* What are the three (or five) most important things about this Company we should be sure to preserve and why?
* What are the top three things we need to change and why?
* What do you most hope I do?
* What are you most concerned I might do? What advice do you have for me?
* What is going well?
* What is not going well?
* What do we need to change?

# Sponsorship (what to ask from a "boss")

* Help Clarify Priority Differences (resolving quickly emerging conflicts both within the project and across projects)
* Help Clarify Authority Relationships (holding others accountable for cooperation and support)
* Help to Remove Obstacles (providing necessary protection and “air cover”)
* Help to Free-up Resources (solidifying focus and commitments especially at “out-of-cycle” times)
* Help to Build Key Contacts and Network Linkages (Facilitating relationships with critical people and areas)

# Pricing

* As technology becomes more stable, so does pricing
* New markets, wild west

# Dealing with genius

* Socialization and ground rules help
* Endear yourself to "Ant" or "Simon" types
* Common goals, stakes in the ground, but not many
* Don't make him a manager

# Changing norms

* Bring an ally if you want to change the culture, or be an ally for someone

# Groups (brainstorming)

* Psychological Safety is important
* No criticism
* Encourage wild ideas
* Combine ideas
* Only works if you have common framework, not one single expert
* If you have an expert or are the expert... be nice! try and learn from ppl
* Generate variance

# TOUGH MEETINGS

* BE BRAVE (Challenger), but be nice about it.... can't just call people frauds or stinkynuts, psychological safety works both ways
* surface problems early... the earlier you discuss problems the better
* Leadership, Common Focus, Common Definiton (USE SIMPLE WORDS, RESTATE THE PROBLEM)
* search for counterexamples on purpose

# Groups (under stress)

* Listen to one person?
* Listen to the lowliest engineer
* Build bridges across depts etc...
