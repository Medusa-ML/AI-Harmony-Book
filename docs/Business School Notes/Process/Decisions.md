# Anchoring matters

* Compare yourself to google employees, not other outsourcers
* Suggested pricing matters

# Group Decisions

* Make people do their homework in advance
* Let the little people speak!
* OPINIONS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT
* Avg guesses are better than individuals guesses
* Average expert opinions if you can

""" When it takes guts for a knowledgable person to speak up, something is broken"""

# If you are an expert...

* Follow Taleb's advice and cloister yourself! don't let other's opinions fuck with your head

# Rules-based decision making
 
* Make your own model (bootstrap if you can), your made-up formula will be better than some ad-hoc bullshit
* Rules force you to be explicit about your biases (10% of wife criteria is based on beauty, 10% on education, 10% on willingness to bang or whatever) 
* Update your rules (retrain your models) as you learn more.

# Bias and Noise
* BIAS: understand and eliminate peoples bias (I don't like calendar projects, some good ones might exist in VC land)
* NOISE: remove the "after lunch" effect, where after lunch you are nicer, or when you are tired you are grumpy

# 538 Model notes
* Nate Silver tries to....

1 Eliminate Bias by correcting polls that always lean one way
2 Eliminate noise by averaging these polls

That's it!

# Design Architecture

* There is no neutral way to design a building, you'll either be running into people or not.
* There is no neutral way to present data. be careful! Words and numbers and familiarity matters

## Be consistent, repetitive, simple and unambiguous.

## FORCE people to think about all of the benefits, enumerate them.  
# People don’t do hard math, do it for them

# UNIT ASKING, THIS IS AMAZING

* Instead of asking “how much will you donate to 20 children?” ask “How much will you donate for 1 child?” and then “ How much can you donate for 20 children?”

# Influence peoples comparables and you can control their decisions!!! Don’t compare me to ukranians, compare me to NASA Scientists

# Set peoples reference points to make them more or less satisfied, look up if you need motivation, look down if you want to be happy with what you have

# SETUP YOUR WORKSPACE RULE, make desirable behaviors easy, and others difficult. THROW AWAY THE BOOZE, or whatever, put the fruit salad in an easier place to get than the dessert.

# Don’t expect the best paying roulette table today to ourperform for you next week.

# Don’t expect the prettiest person in the room to be the most interesting

# The best thing most models do is enforce a consistent process.

# When to use models? Whoever has the most frequent data gets the most models!

# ENCOURAGE A WRITING FIRST CULTURE, if you believe that shit, write it the fuck down, and write it before you share so your brain is captured before it’s corrupted

# PREMORTEM AND KILL CRITERIA
* Identify a goal
* Identify the timeline that it’ll take you to fail
* Imagine you failed
* List 5 reasons you failed that were your fault
* List 5 reasons you failed that were not your fault
* Identify early signals that you’ll fail

then…

do a KILL CRITERIA

If I’m not in state x at time y I kill the whole goddamn thing. 

# When a decision is "hard" that means its easy, if its Paris vs Rome, just pick and don't be a baby about it. If you only had Paris as an option wouldn't you be happy about it?

# Decision Stack, what is the next proof point? Rent first before you buy, make a little test decision first.
