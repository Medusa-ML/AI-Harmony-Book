# Process (VC)
* Diapers.om was selling warehouse process not diapers
* Rent? Outsource? Subsribe? Share?

# You are investing your time, so think like a VC
* what is the $ or effort needed to next proof point?

# WHEN DO YOU NEED PROJECT MANAGEMENT
* Research/Technology - waterfall/studio work, you don't have known outcomes, can't really PM it
* Development - YOU NEED A PM, OUTCOMES ARE KNOWN

# RULES OF THUMB
* 70% CAPACITY is best for factory-line workers/developers


# MAKE THINGS VISIBLE THAT CAN'T BE SEEN
* MAP OUT THE WORK
* VISUALIZE the workflow on a board, you'll need studio-style work to fix
* PRIOROTIY MATRIX, Backlog, Funnel Board, Problem/Fire board 

# DECOMPOSITION / ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (SCIENTIFIC METHOD)
1. Problem Statement (Target - Actual = Gap)... Not "Salespeople are poorly trained" ... Yes "I want to increase sales by $10MM this year"
2. Go See and Map What's Happening (Be embarrassed by what you see, or you're doing it wrong). Why is it going wrong, internal design flaw
3. Target Design, propose a new system that'll be better, What are the new rules of the road?
4. Go run the experiment!

# DSM
* N^2 diagram
* components to components mapping
* connections between components

# CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE LITTLE SHIT
* CI/CD principles
* Fix one thing, over and over again
* Speed up the line slowly for optimal challenge

# BIG IDEA
* DON'T BLAME THE PEOPLE: Not a people problem, a design problem. (Fundamental Attribution Error )
* STATIC DESIGN: Static Design (What you know in advance, org chart) vs Dynamic Design (How to work after it starts). IS IT A FACTORY OR A STUDIO SETUP?
* VISUALIZATION: Assembly line you know when shit is wrong.... knowledge work you cannot. Prevent hiding.

# SMALL, SMALL, SMALL
* Your plan will break in 1-3 months
* Don't have anything set in stone longer than that.
* Success criteria and can you measure it?
* Account setup issue, case study

# ASK DUMB QUESTIONS
* Concious Processing -> Automatic Processing (Danny K)
* Culture is learned "Habit" of a company
* You need to break habits, repeat deliberately 
* Beginners Mind... new people without bad habits can innovate

# DELAY MAINTENANCE TRAP
* "WE AREN'T FIXING ANYTHING"
* Capability degrades slowly
* You have extra capacity right away
* Productivity increases initially, then goes down

# GOOD PROCEDURES
* Particpate, everyone participates, workers define procedures
* Monitoring, we measure that shit
* Updates... if we find a better way we change, name proceduces after people "The Scott Park Method"
