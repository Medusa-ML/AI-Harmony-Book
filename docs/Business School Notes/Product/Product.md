# Ventures

* What is the Total Addressable Market
* What are the number of possible reserve sources or potential payers (direct,b2b, govt etc...)
* "Why Now?"
* What is my customer profile? Pain points (with $ value), gains and jobs to be done.
* Lateral thinking with outdated technology
* HOW CAN I TEST? MVP or POC, Focus group, early samples
* Experiments, cheap first bring risk down think Dropbox video
* Moat: patent, replicatable
* competitors

# Risk

* people don't resist change or hate risk... they hate uncertainty. give them a gradient of what we will certainly do, to what we might do etc...
* Groups make more risky decisions
* Gotta make the unsexy sexy?

# "Experiments" and so called "Failures"

* Quit before you lose
* Pick a new strategy and try again if you need to
* Experiment and be OK with losing

# Value, Profit and Revenue

* Long run, it's all worth 0
* Profit matters
* Profit NOW, Profit SOON
* Find the right price for things, always use comparables
* Bill and price based on value, always have 10 explanations for a price

# Technological adoption

* General purpose technologies are adopted slowly
* Think about the rollout and adoption over time... indoor plumbing in cold climates

# Long vs Short Term

* Got to pay people so they get paid both ways, in the short term and the long term. CEO only gets paid at the IPO
* 90% Maintenance and 10% bullshit :)
