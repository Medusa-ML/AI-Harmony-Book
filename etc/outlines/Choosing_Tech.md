* Copy and make a book on choosing technologies that last... econ history etc... use Robot doing pushups from BookCover.ai)

TODO Write a positioning statement

# Intro, why do we care, why are economics important? What is the goal with all of this? 

People fall in love with a technology. dont do it. Fall in love with a process instead, and also improve that process heyo.

Talk about wharton platform pricing 000020 strategy and how only open source can compete, how to protect yourself from the trap, but benefit from the free stuff... xerox att facebook google etc (talk about amazon, microsoft and samsung with android)


Hackable and Repairable as key aspects of choosing

Openness and Standards Compliance as huge ones (de facto standard counts less) talk about xls docs and pdfs, also inkscape and gimp and pixar using Linux

Mention contractors and how they pick technologies for you, but they might pick shitty ones and you'll get in trouble.

Also talk about how FOSS creates a software paradox Software paradox, FOSS shrinks the market and take 70%, but then use feynmans quote about paradoxes to say that software itself is worth 0. 

note about commodity software. Maintenance Cost, Training Cost, Licencsing Cost, Switching etc... if you time it right you pay less for training and 0 for licensing and switching.  Most companies never pay for switching or training and go bust as soon as they realize those costs. Right to repair software. FSF

# Buy vs Build vs Steal/Copy

Buy vs build is a false choice, there is a third option that is frequently the best, Steal/Copy and participate in a FOSS development cycle that provides much of the features of Buy, without the cost, and the customization of build without the full time-load of building from scratch.

## Security by Obscurity

# Browsers and terminals first? before phones even? Consider it. is the browser more important than the OS, practically speaking?

# Phones

iOS or Pixel Android if you must

Lockdown mode and turn off google settings. Just use a faraday bag.

Faraday cages and bags, talk about nyt guy in ukraine also idaho killers phone

Your phone can kill you. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/14/world/europe/russian-attack-aid-worker-video.html

US companies, easy to update, probably not google mesh.

# IoT

Open source first, Google/Apple second, Amazon/Ring last

# Services and Apps

FOSS
Something you pay for
Everything Else
