# Ethics

Intrinsic Values: Health, Family, Transparency, Integrity, Happiness, Fairness

Every moral choice has two components:
* Principles, does this violate my principles?
* Ends/Utilitarianism, does this lead to good outcomes?

Every choice will have both, most of the time these agree, but when they don't you have to pick. And it'll be tough, like the trolley problem or the James Damore google case or Self Driving Car driver vs Pedestrian decisions
