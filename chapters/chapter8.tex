\textit{"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth -- he could at the same time and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprise of any quarter of the world -- he could secure forthwith, if he wished, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality."} John Maynard Keynes, 1920 \cite{Keynes2012}

\textit{"(Traditional) search engines are databases, organized collections of data that can be stored, updated, and retrieved at will. (Traditional) search engines are indexes. a form of database, that connect things like keywords to URLs; they can be swiftly updated, incrementally, bit by bit (as when you update a phone number in the database that holds your contacts).}

\textit{Large language models do something very different: they are not databases; they are text predictors, turbocharged versions of autocomplete. Fundamentally, what they learn are relationships between bits of text, like words, phrases, even whole sentences. And they use those relationships to predict other bits of text. And then they do something almost magical: they paraphrase those bits of texts, almost like a thesaurus but much much better. But as they do so, as they glom stuff together, something often gets lost in translation: which bits of text do and do not truly belong together."} Gary Marcus, 2023 \cite{marcus2023}

\textit{"The problem with the fast thinking is that it is often wrong. The problem with the slow thinking is that it is often too slow."} Daniel Kahneman, 2011 \cite{Kahneman2011}

\textit{"If you know, in the morning, what your day looks like with any precision you are a little bit dead - the more precision the more dead you are."} -CITE TALEB
