\chapter{DRM Note}

Dear Reader,

Thank you for your interest in \textit{AI Harmony}, my  book exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity. Whether you are a valued subscriber to \href{https://www.patreon.com/bradflaugher}{the Medusa Project} or someone who discovered the book through other means, I am truly grateful for your support.

I am pleased to share that \textit{AI Harmony} is now available in both print and digital formats. You can purchase the book through the website listed below, or other prominent bookstores.

This digital version is provided in a DRM-free ebook format because I firmly believe that DRM often serves as more of a hindrance than a benefit. My goal is to make the book as accessible and user-friendly as possible, but I kindly ask for your respect and honesty in return. Please refrain from illegally sharing or distributing copies of the book. If you want to recommend "AI Harmony" to someone, please direct them to the purchasing options or share my email address with them.

If there is anyone who wants access to the book but finds the cost prohibitive, I am more than willing to help. Please contact me via email, and I will provide a copy. My priority is to ensure that everyone who wants to learn from "AI Harmony" is able to do so.

Thank you again for your understanding, support, and commitment to responsible and fair use of digital materials.

Brad
