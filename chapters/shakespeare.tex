"AI Scientists disagree as to whether these language networks posess true knowledge or are just mimicking humans by remembering the statistics of millions of words. I don't beloive any kind of deep learning network will achieve the goal of AGI if the network doesn't model the world the way the brain does. Deep learning networks work well, but not because they solved the knowledge representation problem. They work well because they avoided it completely, relying on statistics and lots of data instead. How deep learning networks work is clever, their performance impressive, and they are commercially valuable. I am only pointing out that they don't possess knowledge and, therefore, are not on the path to having the ability of a five-year-old child." \cite{hawkins_2022}
