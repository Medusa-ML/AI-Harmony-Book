\section{Model Cards}

Model cards are a way to document the capabilities and limitations of your AI model. They are a useful tool for understanding your model, and for communicating its capabilities and limitations to others. Google (see \url{https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/face-detection}), Huggingface and even small makers of AI models produce model cards to help educate their users and developers, and as you can imagine no one reads them. 

Think of a model card as a passport for your AI model. Just like how a passport tells you important information about a person, like their name, nationality, and date of birth, a model card tells you important information about your AI model, such as its purpose, training data, limitations, and ethical considerations.

Just like a passport, a model card is an important document to have when you're traveling with your AI model. It helps you understand the capabilities and limitations of your model, so you can use it effectively and responsibly.

And, just like how a person's passport can change over time as they visit different countries and have new experiences, a model card can be updated as the AI model is further developed and improved.

In this chapter I am going to create and add commentary to model cards for many popular models. Whether you are a technial person or not I want you to be able to read and understand these, and eventually I want my notes or criticisms to become self-evident. My idea is that once you understand the data that is used to train a model and the domain that it is deployed, you can forecast its strengths and weaknesses almost automatically, let's try a few and see how it goes.

Note that I'll introduce these models in a very particular order. I'll also save the hairiest models (full-self driving and Skynet) their own chapters for a deeper discussion. Try and follow along in the order that I lay out here, but only until you get bored. Once you are bored and can forecast my criticisisms, you can skip around with impunity.

    \item \textbf{Training Data:} The model is trained on a large dataset of numerical simulations of fluid flow patterns, which includes various geometries, fluid properties, and boundary conditions. The data is generated using well-established simulation tools such as the finite element method, finite volume method, or lattice Boltzmann method.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} The model is evaluated on a separate dataset of numerical simulations of fluid flow patterns that are not seen during training. The evaluation dataset includes a variety of geometries, fluid properties, and boundary conditions. The model's performance is measured using common metrics in fluid dynamics such as root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R).
    \item \textbf{Limits and Risks:} This model is intended for scientific and engineering applications and is not directly used for decision-making that affects human lives. However, the model's predictions may indirectly affect human lives by informing engineering design or emergency response planning. It is important to validate the model's accuracy and uncertainty, and to communicate the limitations and assumptions of the model to stakeholders. The model assumes that the fluid flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which may not be accurate for highly turbulent or rarefied flows. The model may also be limited by the numerical precision and stability of the simulation tools used to generate the training data.

One of the main limitations is that it may not always generate text that is grammatically correct or semantically meaningful. Additionally, the model may struggle to capture all of the nuances and complexities of Shakespeare's writing, and may generate text that is not true to the style or spirit of the Bard.
\item \textbf{Common Myths or Misunderstandings:}
There are a few common myths or misunderstandings about the Shakespearean Text Generator. One myth is that the model can perfectly recreate Shakespeare's writing, when in reality it can only generate text that is similar in style.

    \item \textbf{Limits and Risks:} Like any machine learning model, the Artificial General Intelligence Chatbot has limitations and risks. One of the main limitations is that it may not always make accurate predictions, and may overlook important factors or make incorrect predictions about trustworthiness. Additionally, the model may be biased towards certain social behavior and online activities if the training data is not representative of the range of social and online information for the target population.
    \item \textbf{Common Myths or Misunderstandings:} There are a few common myths or misunderstandings about the Artificial Generally Intelligent Chatbot. One myth is that the model can always generate accurate and appropriate responses, when in reality it can only provide a response based on the information it was trained on and may generate nonsensical, offensive, or misleading responses. Another myth is that the model can replace human conversation and understanding, when in reality it is intended to support and enhance human-like conversation and language understanding\sidecite{openaimisuse}.
