\chapter{Model Cards and Case Studies}
\labch{modelcards}

Model cards are a way to document the capabilities and limitations of your AI model. They are a useful tool for understanding your model, and for communicating its capabilities and limitations to others. Google (see \url{https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/face-detection}), Huggingface and even small makers of AI models produce model cards to help educate their users and developers, and as you can imagine no one reads them. 

Think of a model card as a passport for your AI model. Just like how a passport tells you important information about a person, like their name, nationality, and date of birth, a model card tells you important information about your AI model, such as its purpose, training data, limitations, and ethical considerations.

Just like a passport, a model card is an important document to have when you're traveling with your AI model. It helps you understand the capabilities and limitations of your model, so you can use it effectively and responsibly.

And, just like how a person's passport can change over time as they visit different countries and have new experiences, a model card can be updated as the AI model is further developed and improved.

In this chapter I am going to create and add commentary to model cards for many popular models. Whether you are a technial person or not I want you to be able to read and understand these, and eventually I want my notes or criticisms to become self-evident. My idea is that once you understand the data that is used to train a model and the domain that it is deployed, you can forecast its strengths and weaknesses almost automatically, let's try a few and see how it goes.

Note that I'll introduce these models in a very particular order. I'll also save the hairiest models (full-self driving and Skynet) their own chapters for a deeper discussion. Try and follow along in the order that I lay out here, but only until you get bored. Once you are bored and can forecast my criticisisms, you can skip around with impunity.

\section{Shakespearean Text Generation } 

Description:
The Shakespearean Text Generator is a type of language model that's specifically designed to generate text in the style of William Shakespeare. It's based on deep learning algorithms, such as the Transformer architecture, and is trained on a large corpus of Shakespearean text. The model uses this training data to learn patterns and structures in Shakespeare's writing, and can then generate new text that mimics the style and language of the Bard himself.

Training Data:
The Shakespearean Text Generator is trained on a large corpus of text written by William Shakespeare. This can include plays, sonnets, and other works by the Bard. The quality and quantity of the training data will impact the performance of the model, so it's important to use a high-quality corpus that accurately represents Shakespeare's writing.

Evaluation:
The performance of the Shakespearean Text Generator can be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation. Human evaluation is particularly useful for language models like this one, as it allows experts in Shakespearean literature to assess the quality of the generated text and compare it to the real works of Shakespeare.

Use Cases:
The Shakespearean Text Generator has a number of potential use cases, including:

Generating new Shakespearean-style plays or sonnets
Analyzing Shakespeare's writing style and language
Creating educational materials and games that teach students about Shakespeare and his works
Providing inspiration for creative writing and poetry
Limits and Risks:
Like any language model, the Shakespearean Text Generator has limitations and risks. One of the main limitations is that it may not always generate text that is grammatically correct or semantically meaningful. Additionally, the model may struggle to capture all of the nuances and complexities of Shakespeare's writing, and may generate text that is not true to the style or spirit of the Bard.

Common Myths or Misunderstandings:
There are a few common myths or misunderstandings about the Shakespearean Text Generator. One myth is that the model can perfectly recreate Shakespeare's writing, when in reality it can only generate text that is similar in style. Another myth is that the model is only useful for generating text, when in reality it can also be used for other tasks, such as analyzing Shakespeare's writing style and language.
