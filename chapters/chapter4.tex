\chapter{Model Cards and Case Studies}
\labch{intro}

I like huggingface's model cards this chapter is inspired by their outline, but adds some of my commentary \url{https://huggingface.co/blog/model-cards}

\section{Fluid Dynamics}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Description} This AI model is designed to count sperm in a video of semen under a microscope.
\item \textbf{Training Data} The model was trained on a large dataset of semen videos taken under a microscope. The training data was annotated with the number of sperm in each video, allowing the model to learn the patterns and features of sperm in different types of semen samples.
\item \textbf{Evaluation Metrics} The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score, which are commonly used metrics for object counting tasks. The model achieved high scores on all metrics, indicating that it is effective at accurately counting sperm in the semen videos.
\item \textbf{Use Cases} This model can be used in clinical or research settings to quickly and accurately count sperm in semen samples. This can be useful for diagnosing and monitoring male infertility, as well as for understanding the impact of various factors on sperm count.
\item \textbf{Limits and Risks} Concept Drift and Transfer Learning! The model is only trained to count sperm in semen videos taken under a microscope and may not perform well on videos taken under different conditions or with different types of microscopes. It is important to ensure that the semen samples are of high quality and that the video recording conditions are consistent in order to obtain accurate results.
\item \textbf{Disclaimer} This model is not intended to replace human expert judgment and should be used as a tool to support decision making. The results generated by this model are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
\item \textbf{The Myth} Talk about how folks infer causality, even though we are not doing science here.
\end{itemize}
