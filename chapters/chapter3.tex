\section{Theories of Creativity}

Machine learning models use data (from the past) to discover rules and make classifications. Because of the way they are constructed these classifications, suggestions, artworks are by definition derivative or "having parts that originate from another source". I won't get into a philosophical discussion on what the nature of creativity is, but it's worth considering how using deep learning AI models biases us towards the past, but also could give us insights from other domains. 

It can be argued that creativity is simply the combination of existing works. This is because many new ideas and innovations are often inspired by and built upon existing concepts. For example, a new form of music may be created by combining elements from different genres. Similarly, a new technology may be created by combining and improving upon existing technologies.

It can also be argued that creativity involves much more than just combining existing works. Creativity is not just about recombining existing ideas, but also about coming up with completely new and original concepts. This requires a unique perspective and a deep understanding of the subject matter, as well as the ability to think outside the box.

AI models of speech, when heavily used, may slow down the evolution of language. AI art models may slow down "progress" in art, whatever that means. AI models of disease trained on data from 1980 may be irrelevant to today's diseases\sidenote{We'll discuss "concept drift" later, don't worry.}. That said these same models may give us interesting insights in new domains, models trained on beautiful paintings may be put to use in a new domain (like desiging beautiful interiors) and that model could give new insight to interior designers, models of the interaction of ants could be put to use in designing cities and so on and so forth. AI cuts many ways, it makes us faster but makes us more reliant on the past, models can be used across domains but should be used intentionally and transparently when possible. Each use opens up a new world of possibilites for users, and sometimes a new headache for intellectual property lawyers. We'll discuss all of these topics in this chapter.


\section{Creative Uses of Power Tools}

Power tools, even simple ones like a drill\sidenote{something like these \url{https://www.dewalt.com/products/power-tools/drills}} are complex machines that take human input and transform it using static rules. The pressure the user of a drill puts on the bit and the speed at which they pull the trigger all deterministically affect the output. Just because a tool is a deterministic machine doesn't mean it is unable to produce creatve works.

What is happening as we use generative tools like ChatGPT or image-to-textmodels is that the "creative act" has been relocated. The creative act is now the prompt you give the tool, the users input. And someone can still be good at using AI, just like someone can be good at using any piece of software.

Modern AI is a complex system of algorithms, data, and analytics that can be used to solve complex problems. AI systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions about the future. AI systems are typically used to automate and assist human decision making. AI systems are programmed with specific objectives and goals, and the user input decides the output. For example, an AI system could be programmed to solve a mathematical problem and the user input would determine the parameters of the problem and the output would be the solution.

A power drill is also a complex deterministic system. The user input is limited to the type of drill bit, the speed of the drill, and the direction of the drill. The output is determined by these inputs, as the drill will only drill in the direction and speed determined by the user. The user also has to choose the correct drill bit to ensure the drill can do the job correctly and safely.

        \labfig{drillart}
\end{marginfigure}

Overall, both modern AI and a power drill are complex but ultimately deterministic systems. The user input, however limited it may be, ultimately controls the output of the system. Both systems require a user to understand how to use them and to make the correct input to get the desired output.

\section{Garbage In, Garbage Out}

You are essentially programming with data, so if your data sucks so will your prediction, you also really can't generalize, only correllate.

\section{Garbage In, New Perspective Out?}

What about cross-domain models, where maybe I train with a poetry dataset, and point my language model on nonfiction.... hmmm.

it would not come up with urinal art though \url{https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-duchamps-urinal-changed-art-forever}

\section{Concept Drift}

When the meaning of truth changes.

\section{The Impossibility of Fairness}

Representation, "fixing the training set" \sidecite{Christian2020}, or the Impossibility of Fairness from a model.

\section{What Are We Prediciting Again?}

are you predicting the right thing? Are you really predicting how valuable the company is or just whether it'll be the next meme stock?

\section{Humans Love Computers}

Working together seems like a good idea, but how. Talk about 2 percent model control and model uptake. 

Also talk about Kasparov's tournament and Thinking for yourself in the age of AI. \sidecite{mansharamani2020}

\section{Key Takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep learning models are fundamentally large unscientific regressions} they are trained to create a function that maps input data to output data.
    \item \textbf{Deep learning models are chaotic systems containing millions of interacting parameters} they are not designed to be explained or created in a way that their weights can be used for scientific analysis. They find reasonable answers and don't care how they get there. Multicolinearity (understanding the relationship of an input and output) and feature importance (understanding which inputs are most important) are only understandable with a high level of statistical error.
    \item \textbf{Small changes in inputs of a deep learning model may dramatically change the outputs} deep learning models are complex deterministic systems that can exhibit chaotic behavior. Their inner workings are functionally unknowable and practically impossible to test.
    \item \textbf{Deep learning models can have impressive and useful outputs, but the creators of models should be encouraged to highlight their failures and limitations.} Machine learning engineers might be more keen to highlight failures and limitations if they are encouraged to do so by their users, managers and investors.
\end{itemize}
