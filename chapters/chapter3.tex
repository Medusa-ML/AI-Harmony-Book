\section{Concept Drift}

\section{Theories of Creativity}

Is creativity combining exsiting things, or is it coming up with something new?

Does progress slow down becasue we heavily rely (more than usual) on the work of the past to generate future work?

\section{From Spaghetti Code to Lasagna Neuron Layers}

These layers are totally transparent, but you can't understand them because they're complicated :)

\section{Garbage In, Garbage Out}

You are essentially programming with data, so if your data sucks so will your prediction, you also really can't generalize, only correllate.

\section{Garbage In, New Perspective Out?}

What about cross-domain models, where maybe I train with a poetry dataset, and point my language model on nonfiction.... hmmm.

\section{The Impossibility of Fairness}

Representation, "fixing the training set" \sidecite{Christian2020}, or the Impossibility of Fairness from a model.

\section{What Are We Prediciting Again?}

are you predicting the right thing? Are you really predicting how valuable the company is or just whether it'll be the next meme stock?

\section{The Perverse Incentives of Data Scientists: Job Security by Obscurity}

Investors want predictions, Data Scientists don't have good data, but want to keep their jobs. Bad science rolls downhill to the user, and takes a long time to snuff out. 

\section{Humans Love Computers}

Working together seems like a good idea, but how. Talk about 2 percent model control and model uptake. 

Also talk about Kasparov's tournament. \sidecite{mansharamani_2020}
