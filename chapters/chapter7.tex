\section{Sucker Traps}

Blurry JPEg of the web \url{https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web}

\textit{"(Traditional) search engines are databases, organized collections of data that can be stored, updated, and retrieved at will. (Traditional) search engines are indexes. a form of database, that connect things like keywords to URLs; they can be swiftly updated, incrementally, bit by bit (as when you update a phone number in the database that holds your contacts).}

\textit{Large language models do something very different: they are not databases; they are text predictors, turbocharged versions of autocomplete. Fundamentally, what they learn are relationships between bits of text, like words, phrases, even whole sentences. And they use those relationships to predict other bits of text. And then they do something almost magical: they paraphrase those bits of texts, almost like a thesaurus but much much better. But as they do so, as they glom stuff together, something often gets lost in translation: which bits of text do and do not truly belong together."} Gary Marcus, 2023 \cite{marcus2023}

"The sucker's trap is when you focus on what you know and what others don't know, rather than the reverse."

\section{Thinking Fast and Slow}

\textit{"The problem with the fast thinking is that it is often wrong. The problem with the slow thinking is that it is often too slow."} Daniel Kahneman, 2011 \cite{Kahneman2011}
