    \item\textit{First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.}
    \item\textit{Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.}
    \item\textit{Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.}

\section{Semiautonomy is Stupid}

Talk about the levels 0-4, deep learning is a subsystem of these levels.

Semiautonomy is dumb because it feels autonomous, but the user is expected to take over at any time. This is the worst of both worlds. \cite{torchinsky_boeckmann_2019}

\section{Trolley Problems}

\section{Concept Drift (Reprise)}

\section{Multicolinearity (Reprise)}

\sidenote{You can't get your self-driving car dirty either, it'll mess up those sensors.}

\section{See You In Court, Asshole!}

\section{A Train is a Self-Driving Car, Right?}

Discuss how the problem space has changed in warehousing, we don't actually have self-driving forklifts, we have moving shelves.

Maybe talk about elon musk and manufacturing.
