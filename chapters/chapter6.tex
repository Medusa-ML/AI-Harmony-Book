\textit{"The second requirement of goal-misalignment risk is that an intelligent machine can commandeer the Earth's resources to pursue its goals, or in other ways prevent us from stopping it... We have similar concerns with humans. This is why no single person or entity can control the entire internet and why we require multiple people to launch a nuclear missile. Intelligent machines will not develop misaligned goals unless we go to great lengths to endow them with that ability. Even if they did, no machine can commandeer the world's resources unless we let it. We don't let a single human, or even a small number of humans, control the world's resources. We need to be similarly careful with machines."} Jeff Hawkins, 2022 \cite{hawkins2022}
