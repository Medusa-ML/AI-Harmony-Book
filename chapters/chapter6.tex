\textit{"We think of automation as a machine doing a task that a human used to do... you might think that means a human does nothing. But in fact there's abundant literature that shows the human is not incurring no workload, the human is now doing a different task and that task tends to be monitoring, a vigilance task, looking for rare events...that is a task that humans are not well-equipped to do." - Dr. Michael Nees, 2021} \cite{nees2021}
