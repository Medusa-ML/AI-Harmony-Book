Welcome to "AI Harmony: Blending Human Expertise and AI for Business Success." This book is a comprehensive guide that will help you understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI) works and how you can use it to your advantage. My goal is to provide you with a clear and unbiased understanding of AI, without the need for a technical background.

As you read through the chapters, you'll learn about how AI models are trained, with in-depth analysis of every common use case I believe is important. In chapter five, we'll delve into the specifics of AI training and explore how it can be used for business success. I've also dedicated entire chapters to the topics of autonomous weapons and self-driving cars, which I believe are important areas to consider when thinking about AI.

My hope is that this book will be useful to all readers, regardless of their role in the world of AI. Whether you're a user, developer, or investor in AI, there's something in here for you. Feel free to skip around and read the stories that interest you most - although I highly recommend the first four chapters as a must-read for everyone.

I've enjoyed writing this book and I hope you'll enjoy reading it. And if you have any notes or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at \href{mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com}{brad@bradflaugher.com}.

Remember, the goal of this book is not to be read from cover to cover, but to be used as a reference and guide for understanding AI. So take your time, read what interests you, and feel free to come back to other sections later.

Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. I hope you find this book informative, useful, and enjoyable.
