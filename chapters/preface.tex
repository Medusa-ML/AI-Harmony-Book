This book is a humble attempt to organize my thoughts on the ever-evolving field of decision making with computers. I was first published on this subject in the Journal of Computational Neurodynamics in 2008 and since then I have followed the developments in the field closely, particularly the development of deep learning models using artificial neural networks (commonly known as artificial intelligence or AI). I was published just that once, then spent the next dozen years working for various high-speed decision making operations in finance and online advetising; if you have seen an ad online, you have probably seen my work. I now spend my time training young machine learning engineers (\url(https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html)), contracting for (\url(https://inoxoft.com/)) and investing in startups (\url(https://ventures.nextfab.com/about/)).  

I find most writing on artificial intelligence to be either too technical for the general public or too biased towards what I'll call "AI extremism" by investors and employees of AI companies, or by modern day luddites who shun all technology and fail to take time to understand it. My goal is to help my readers develop a broad understanding of how the technology works so they can be masters of it. I'll discuss in detail how models are trained and provide analysis of 34 common use cases in chapter four, I also dedicate entire chapters to discussing autonomous weapons and self-driving cars, and try to end by providing a framework for precisely understanding how careers and jobs will be transformed by deep learning models.

Whether you are a user of AI (we all are, whether we like it or not), a developer of AI, or a businessperson curious about investing your time and money in AI businesses, I hope you find this book useful.

As you journey through these pages, please feel free to skim, skip around, and read some stories. I think the first three chapters are particularly important for everyone to know, and the rest of the stories can be chosen a la carte. So let's get started, and I hope you enjoy this book as much as I've enjoyed writing it. If you have notes for me you can reach me at \href{mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com}{brad@bradflaugher.com}.

PS Thank you Angela Altamirano for the cover wonderful cover art. Thank you to my early supporters, William Dickson, Daniel Hoevel, Patrick Maloney, Jerrod Howlett and Jeff Zinser. A special thank you to Louis Cid and the Harvard Club of New York for giving me an early forum. Finally thank you to Dr. Péter Érdi for putting me under his wing many years ago and Dr. Elisa Esposito for her constant support. 

PPS This book uses the wonderful free and open source kaobook LaTeX project (\url{https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook}) and  many Free and Open Source AI  models for text and image generation like Stable Diffusion (\url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion}) and Mann-E (\url{https://huggingface.co/mann-e/mann-e_4_rev-0-1}) and some commercial models like GPT-3, ChatGPT and Dall-E from OpenAI (\url{https://openai.com/}).
