This book is an attempt to organize my brain on paper. I have been thinking about decision making with computers, and the computer's relationship to the brain for too long now, and before I get dementia (I'm 35) I would like to put a stake in the ground and tell everyone where they can stick their thoughts about the future. 

I am simultaneously very hopeful for the future, and horrified by the way that people talk about it. I think many so-called "Data Scientists" are full of shit when they talk, and some of them know it but would like to keep their jobs. I think that many investors are snowed by fancy language and toy demos that they extrapolate into the future. Users of digital products are woefully ignorant about how the products work and how they fit into a larger ecosystem. I'm simultaneously amused and annoyed. I also have time to set the record straight, so I'll try. 

This book contains strong beliefs, weakly held. If I say something stupid I'll eat my hat and update the book if I have time, or just trash the thing and say "please don't read this, consider it my diary from 2023". However, for now I think I am right and I think you should listen to me for a moment.

I am a self-employed programmer and financially secure, these are my credentials. I have no corporate master and I am not raising money to create the future of AI, so have no bias towards boosterism. I write programs close enough to the bleeding-edge that I can see the present as fast as almost anyone.

So let's go on this journey together, I'll try and explain to you (with words, code and examples) how modern AI works, and when you should be scared (self-driving cars without the appropriate infrastucture) or when you should not be scared (please shut up about Skynet becoming self-aware). I'll also try do case studies in as many arenas that I think are interesting. If you have notes for me you can reach me at brad@bradflaugher.com.

Please skim this book, please skip around and read some stories. I think the first chapter is important for everyone to know. The rest of the stories can be chosen a la carte. Enjoy.
