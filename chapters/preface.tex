I've noticed that most writing on AI either requires a technical background or is heavily influenced by biased investors, employees of AI companies, or technophobes who refuse to give it a chance. My goal with this book is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of how AI works, so they can master it for themselves. You'll learn about how models are trained, with in-depth analysis of every common use case I think is important in chapter four. I also dedicate entire chapters to autonomous weapons and self-driving cars, and provide a framework for understanding how deep learning models will transform careers and jobs in the concluding chapter.

Whether you're a user, developer, or investor in AI, I hope you'll find this book useful. Feel free to skip around and read the stories that interest you most - although I highly recommend the first three chapters as a must-read for everyone. I've enjoyed writing this book and I hope you'll enjoy reading it. And if you have any notes or feedback, you can always reach me at \href{mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com}{brad@bradflaugher.com}.
