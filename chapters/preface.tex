This book is an attempt to organize my thoughts on decision making with computers. I had the pleasure of publishing on this subject in the Journal of Computational Neurodynamics back in 2008. Since then, I've kept up with the latest developments in the field, especially the advancements in deep learning using artificial neural networks, or what some call "AI." But my interests didn't stop there – for over a decade, I've been working on high-speed decision making operations in finance and online advertising. You may have even seen some of my work while browsing the web. Nowadays, I enjoy training young machine learning engineers (\url{https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html}), as well as contracting for (\url{https://inoxoft.com/}) and investing in startups (\url{https://ventures.nextfab.com/about/}).

But enough about me. Let's talk about the book. I've noticed that most writing on AI either requires a technical background or is heavily influenced by biased investors, employees of AI companies, or technophobes who refuse to give it a chance. My goal with this book is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of how AI works, so they can master it for themselves. You'll learn about how models are trained, with in-depth analysis of 34 common use cases in chapter four. I also dedicate entire chapters to autonomous weapons and self-driving cars, and provide a framework for understanding how deep learning models will transform careers and jobs in the concluding chapter.

Whether you're a user, developer, or investor in AI, I hope you'll find this book useful. Feel free to skip around and read the stories that interest you most - although I highly recommend the first three chapters as a must-read for everyone. I've enjoyed writing this book and I hope you'll enjoy reading it. And if you have any notes or feedback, you can always reach me at \href{mailto:brad@bradflaugher.com}{brad@bradflaugher.com}.

PS Thank you Angela Altamirano for the cover wonderful cover art. Thank you to my early supporters, William Dickson, Daniel Hoevel, Patrick Maloney, Jerrod Howlett and Jeff Zinser. A special thank you to Louis Cid and the Harvard Club of New York for giving me an early forum. Finally thank you to Dr. Péter Érdi for putting me under his wing many years ago and Dr. Elisa Esposito for her constant support. 

PPS This book uses the wonderful free and open source kaobook LaTeX project (\url{https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook}) and  many Free and Open Source AI  models for text and image generation like Stable Diffusion (\url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion}) and Mann-E (\url{https://huggingface.co/mann-e/mann-e_4_rev-0-1}) and some commercial models like GPT-3, ChatGPT and Dall-E from OpenAI (\url{https://openai.com/}).
